# CheXNet Model For Pneumonia Detection: "Copy of Pneumonia - 99% accuracy using Densenet121"
The previous studies and research papers show the accuracy of 93.8% by DenseNet and by normal  proposed model achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 97.03%.
The results demonstrated accuracy rates of 92% for Normal and 97% for Pneumonia. The models also showed significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and reduced time for disease detection compared to traditional methods.
